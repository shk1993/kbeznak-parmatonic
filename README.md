# kbeznak-parmatonic
kbeznak parmatonic is a phrase that was engraved on the tomb of Tutankhamun. 
some facts about the tut:

1. King Tut was nicknamed the Boy King because he began his reign when he was only nine years old!

2. Tutankhamun died when he was only 18, and his body was mummified, which is how the ancient Egyptians preserved their dead.

3. His golden coffin was buried in a tomb in the Valley Of The Kings , surrounded by 5,000 priceless treasures

4. These treasures included a golden throne, crown and cobra, pottery and big chests

5. Along with a golden burial mask, King Tut’s sandals were also found in the tomb. These had paintings of his enemies on the soles – so everywhere the king went, he trampled all over his foes! 

I also want to talk about some of the egyptian gods :

The nascent stages of ancient Egyptian mythology were presumably influenced by the natural surroundings and events affecting Egypt itself. For example, the cyclic pattern of the sun and seasonal pattern of Nile floods (that enriched the soil) played their crucial roles in establishing the water and the sun as symbols of life. The very geographical core of the ancient Egyptian civilization – the fertile Nile Delta, was surrounded by arid lands and deserts (populated by fringe groups of raiders and nomads). Inspired by these real-time scenarios, the ancient Egyptians regarded their land as the haven for tranquil stability, which in turn was ringed by swathes of lawless realms – thus essentially creating the trichotomy of order, chaos, and renewal; themes that are integral to the Egyptian gods and goddesses.
